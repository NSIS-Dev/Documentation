# BrandingText

Sets the text that is shown (by default it is 'Nullsoft Install System vX.XX') at the bottom of the install window. Setting this to an empty string ("") uses the default; to set the string to blank, use " " (a space). If it doesn't matter to you, leave it the default so that everybody can know why the installer didn't suck. heh. Use `/TRIMLEFT`, `/TRIMRIGHT` or `/TRIMCENTER` to trim down the size of the control to the size of the string.

## Parameters

    /TRIM(LEFT|RIGHT|CENTER) text
