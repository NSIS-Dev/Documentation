    Standard (built-in) string tests (which are case-insensitive):
         a == b; a != b
    Additional case-insensitive string tests (using System.dll):
         a S< b; a S>= b; a S> b; a S<= b
    Case-sensitive string tests:
         a S== b; a S!= b
    Standard (built-in) signed integer tests:
         a = b; a <> b; a < b; a >= b; a > b; a <= b
    Standard (built-in) unsigned integer tests:
         a U< b; a U>= b; a U> b; a U<= b
    64-bit integer tests (using System.dll):
        a L= b; a L<> b; a L< b; a L>= b; a L> b; a L<= b
    Built-in NSIS flag tests:
        ${Abort}; ${Errors}; ${RebootFlag}; ${Silent}
    Built-in NSIS other tests:
        ${FileExists} a
    Any conditional NSIS instruction test:
        ${Cmd} a
    Section flag tests:
        ${SectionIsSelected} a; ${SectionIsSectionGroup} a;
        ${SectionIsSectionGroupEnd} a; ${SectionIsBold} a;
        ${SectionIsReadOnly} a; ${SectionIsExpanded} a;
        ${SectionIsPartiallySelected} a
