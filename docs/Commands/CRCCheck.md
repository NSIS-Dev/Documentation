# CRCCheck

Specifies whether or not the installer will perform a CRC on itself before allowing an install. Note that if the user uses `/NCRC` on the command line when executing the installer, and you didn't specify 'force', the CRC will not occur, and the user will be allowed to install a (potentially) corrupted installer.

## Parameters
