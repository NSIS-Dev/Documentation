# FileBufSize

This command sets the size of the compiler's internal file buffers. This command allows you to control the compiler's memory usage by limiting how much of a given file it will load into memory at once. Since the compiler needs both input and output, twice the memory size specified could be used at any given time for file buffers. This command does not limit the compression buffers which could take another couple of MB, neither does it limit the compiler's other internal buffers, but those shouldn't normally top 1MB anyway. Specifying a very small number could decrease performance. Specifying a very large number could exhaust system resources and force the compiler to cancel the compilation process. The default value is 32MB.
