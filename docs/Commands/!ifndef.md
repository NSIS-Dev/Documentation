# !ifndef

The opposite of [`!ifdef`][1]. This command, when paired with an [`!endif`][2] command, will tell the compiler whether or not to compile the lines in between the two lines. If gflag is globally defined (using [`!define`][3] or the `/D` switch), then the contained lines will be compiled. Otherwise, they will be skipped. 'bcheck' can be specified as `&` (boolean and) or `|` (boolean or) along with more gflags -- precedence is simple, left to right.

## Parameters

    gflag [bcheck gflag [...]]]

## Example

    !define SOMETHING
    !ifdef SOMETHING
        !echo "SOMETHING is defined"
    !endif

    !undef SOMETHING
    !ifndef SOMETHING
        !echo "SOMETHING is not defined"
    !endif
