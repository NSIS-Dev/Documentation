# LicenseData

Specifies a text file or a RTF file to use for the license that the user can read. Omit this to not have a license displayed. Note that the file must be in DOS text format (\\r\\n). To define a multilingual license data use [`LicenseLangString`][1].

If you are using a RTF file it is recommended that you edit it with WordPad and not MS Word. Using WordPad will result in a much smaller file.

Use [`LicenseLangString`][1] to show a different license for every language.
