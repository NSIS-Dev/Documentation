# Int64CmpU

*This function is only available when building a 64-bit installer.*

Compares two unsigned integers val1 and val2. If val1 and val2 are equal, [`Goto`][1] jump\_if\_equal, otherwise if val1 < val2, [`Goto`][1] jump\_if\_val1\_less, otherwise if val1 > val2, [`Goto`][1] jump\_if\_val1\_more. Performs the comparison as unsigned integers. Same as [IntCmpU][2], but treats the values as 64-bit integers.

## Parameters

    val1 val2 jump_if_equal [jump_if_val1_less] [jump_if_val1_more]
