# !execute

This command will execute 'command' using a call to _CreateProcess()_. Unlike [`!system`][1], it does not use the command line processor, so input/output redirection and commands like 'cd', 'dir' and 'type' can not be used. `!execute` also ignores the return value of the executed command. Currently, the only known advantage of `!execute` over [`!system`][1] is that it does not give trouble when the current working directory is specified using UNC.
On POSIX platforms, `!execute` will use _system()_ just like [`!system`][1].
