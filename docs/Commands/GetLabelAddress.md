# GetLabelAddress

Gets the address of the label and stores it in the output user variable. This user variable then can be passed to [`Call`][1] or [`Goto`][2]. Note that you may only call this with labels accessible from your function, but you can call it from anywhere (which is potentially dangerous). Note that if you [`Call`][1] the output of `GetLabelAddress`, code will be executed until it [`Return`][3]'s (explicitly or implicitly at the end of a function), and then you will be returned to the statement after the [`Call`][1].

## Parameters

    user_var(output) label
