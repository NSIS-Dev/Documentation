# !finalize

This option will execute 'command' using a call to _system()_ after the output EXE has been generated. You can typically use it to sign (Authenticode) your installer. If 'command' contains a '%1' it will be replaced by the executable filename.
On POSIX platforms, `!execute` will use _system()_ just like [`!system`][1].
