# BringToFront

Makes the installer window visible and brings it to the top of the window list. If an application was executed that shows itself in front of the installer, a BringToFront would bring the installer back in focus.

Recent Windows versions restrict the setting of foreground windows. If the user is working with another application during installation, the user may be notified using a different method.
