# SectionSetInstTypes

Sets the install types the section specified by section\_index defaults to the enabled state in. Note that the section index starts with zero. Every bit of inst\_types is a flag that tells if the section is in that install type or not. For example, if you have 3 install types and you want the first section to be included in install types 1 and 3, then the command should look like this:

## Parameters

    section_index inst_types

## Example

    SectionSetInstTypes 0 5
    # because the binary value for 5 is "00000101". The error flag will be set if the section index specified is out of range.

    Section test test_section_id
    SectionEnd

    Function .onInit
        # associate section 'test' with installation types 3 and 4
        SectionSetInstTypes ${test_section_id} 12
    FunctionEnd
