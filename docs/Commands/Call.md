# Call

Calls the function named function\_name, the label named label\_name, or a variable that specifies an address. An address is returned by [`GetCurrentAddress`][1], [`GetFunctionAddress`][2] or [`GetLabelAddress`][3]. A call returns when it encounters a [`Return`][4] instruction. Sections and functions are automatically ended with a Return instruction. Uninstall functions cannot be called from installer functions and sections, and vice-versa.

## Parameters

    function_name | :label_name | user_var(input)

## Example

    Function func
          Call :label
          DetailPrint "#1: This will only appear 1 time."
        label:
          DetailPrint "#2: This will appear before and after message #1."
          Call :.global_label
    FunctionEnd
     
    Section
          Call func
