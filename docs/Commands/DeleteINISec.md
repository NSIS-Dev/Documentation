# DeleteINISec

Delete file (which can be a file or wildcard, but should be specified with a full path) from the target system. If `/REBOOTOK` is specified and the file cannot be deleted then the file is deleted when the system reboots -- if the file will be deleted on a reboot, the reboot flag will be set. The error flag is set if files are found and cannot be deleted. The error flag is not set from trying to delete a file that does not exist.
