# .onGUIInit

This callback will be called just before the first page is loaded and the installer dialog is shown, allowing you to tweak the user interface.

## Example

    !include "WinMessages.nsh"

    Function .onGUIInit
        # 1028 is the id of the branding text control
        GetDlgItem $R0 $HWNDPARENT 1028
        CreateFont $R1 "Tahoma" 10 700
        SendMessage $R0 ${WM_SETFONT} $R1 0
        # set background color to white and text color to red
        SetCtlColors $R0 FFFFFF FF0000
    FunctionEnd
